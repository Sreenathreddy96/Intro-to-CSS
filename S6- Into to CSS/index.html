        <p>Sunrisers Hyderabad (stylised as SunRisers Hyderabad, abbr. SRH) are a
            professional franchise cricket team based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India,
            that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The franchise is owned
            by Kalanithi Maran of the SUN Group and was founded in 2012 after the
            Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were terminated by the IPL. The team is
            currently coached by Daniel Vettori and captained by Pat Cummins. Their
            primary home ground is the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in
            Hyderabad, which has a capacity of 39,000.The team was considered one of
            the best bowling sides, often admired for its ability to defend low
            totals, but now has shifted to a remarkable batting side, according to
            many cricket pundits. The team also holds the record for the highest-ever
            IPL total with 287 runs. David Warner is the leading run scorer for the
            side, having won the Orange Cap three times, in 2015, 2017, and 2019.[8]
            Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the leading wicket-taker having won the Purple Cap
            twice, in 2016 and 2017. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the brand
            value of the Sunrisers Hyderabad which saw a decline of 4 percent to
            US$57.4 million in 2020 as the overall brand value of the IPL decreased to
            US$4.4 billion, according to Brand Finance.</p>
